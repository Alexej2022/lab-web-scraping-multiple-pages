    "#Their flagship product is the music recommender, which you can try at www.gnoosic.com. \n",
    "#The site asks users to input 3 bands they like, and computes similarity scores \n",

    "#that users with similar tastes have picked.\n",
    "\n",
    "# \"Gnod\" is a small company, and its only revenue stream so far are adds in the site.\n",

    "#The Internet is full of information and our first step is to acquire it do an initial \n",
    "#exploration. Feel free to use APIs or directly scrape the web to collect as much \n",
    "#information as possible from popular songs. Eventually, we'll need to collect data \n",

    "#source and see if the collected features are useful.\n",
